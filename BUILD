Virtual Dimension build information
-----------------------------------

VD can be build using the following:
	- GCC version 3.2.3 (as in Mingw3.1.0.1. DO NOT UPDATE GCC: newer versions crash VD...)
	- Latest binutils (2.15.91-20040904-1)
	- Latest w32api (v3.5)
	- Latest mingw runtime (v3.9)

You will also need MSYS or cygwin, to provide make and the shell commands used during the build.

To build, go into the directory where you have the sources, and type:
	make

This will build VD into a directory called 'mingw-release'.

Some options can be passed to makefile:
	DEBUG=1			to make debug build (by default into the 'mingw-debug' directory)
	BUILDDIR=... 	to specify a build directory

Have fun!
